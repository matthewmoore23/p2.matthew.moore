	C. For my sketch, I wanted to design something minimalistic while still covering the required features.
</p>

<p>
	The right side has things that have the greatest importance to you when you wake up: the time, the weather, and the news.
	
</p>
<p>
	It also contains the mirror up time, although that isnt as important. The left side contains the social feed items and calendar.
</p>

<p>
	the final thing, text messages, are located up top. I've been getting a lot of spam messages lately so I thought it be funny to have an incoming spam message.
</p>

<p>
	The center piece, of course, being a person in the middle. this is why i decided to put things in corners more so than just on the side: more space to see yourself.
</p>

<p>
	B. On to the explaination of my mirror, starting from the bottom left. The weight is input from a JSON file that is loaded from the same directory of the project file. I mistakenly said it was input by API in the video, but that is incorrect. It's from a JSON file.
</p>

<p>
	The actually weight widget itself displays your current weight, the previous weeks weight, and a target weight. Since it's from a JSON file it's easily customizable, so you could add something like total weight lost per week or something like that.
</p>

<p>
	Onto the bottom right, the news widget has it's input from a JSON file. Originally, it was input from an API and worked the exact same way it does now, but after reading the terms of the API i was using I realized that if I loaded my project anywhere but my IDE, it wouldnt display the news.
</p>

<p>
	An easy solution to this was just to go to the API page and download the JSON file manually, and after changing the url loaded in loadJSON (the method loading every JSON file), it worked exactly the same as it did before. On to the design choice of the News widget, I purposefully picked only BBC News articles
</p>

<p>
	mainly because they don't have sensational titles. I also decided to only list two articles (the top 2 most popular headlines that day) because any more could distract the user from brushing their teeth or hair, and it would be harder to fit more text on the mirror while still allowing it to be legible.
</p>

<p>
	Above the news is the Calendar widget. It's also loaded from a JSON file and is very customizable just like the weight widget. It'll update depending on what the output of the day() function in p5js outputs. Not much else to say. I did attempt to implement an api for the calendar but there wasn't much documentation on the APIS i found.
