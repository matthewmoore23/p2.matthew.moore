	C. For my sketch, I wanted to design something minimalistic while still covering the required features.
</p>

<p>
	The right side has things that have the greatest importance to you when you wake up: the time, the weather, and the news.
	
</p>
<p>
	It also contains the mirror up time, although that isnt as important. The left side contains the social feed items and calendar.
</p>

<p>
	the final thing, text messages, are located up top. I've been getting a lot of spam messages lately so I thought it be funny to have an incoming spam message.
</p>

<p>
	The center piece, of course, being a person in the middle. this is why i decided to put things in corners more so than just on the side: more space to see yourself.
</p>

<p>
	B. On to the explaination of my mirror, starting from the bottom left. The weight is input from a JSON file that is loaded from the same directory of the project file. I mistakenly said it was input by API in the video, but that is incorrect. It's from a JSON file.
</p>

<p>
	The actually weight widget itself displays your current weight, the previous weeks weight, and a target weight. Since it's from a JSON file it's easily customizable, so you could add something like total weight lost per week or something like that.
